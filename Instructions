New approach create new vectors of vectors for all the scaled contours as well as one for the collapsed version. Then have the scaleHull and collapseContour functions return a vector of points that can be set equal to the appropriate position in the corresponding vector of vectors.
Then print becomes much more versatile, and we have all copies of our contours stored for reference. 
Do all scaling and collapsing within main function then run print.
